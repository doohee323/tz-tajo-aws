tz-tajo
=====================================

I made a batch application for cohort analysis with Apache TAJO. the feature is like this,

1. create 10 spot instances
2. check the instances status and tajo workers' health
3. create a tajo table on S3 for TETON log files (user, event)
4. create a result tajo table for result saving on S3
5. execute cohort query and insert the result to the result tajo table
6. download the result CSV file from S3
7. create a table in mysql
8. load the result CSV file to the table in mysql
9. terminate 10 spot instances

The only thing I have to fix is getting the result CSV file from S3.
Once we got a base for analysis automation tool, so we just need to change the tajo query for the next requirement.
